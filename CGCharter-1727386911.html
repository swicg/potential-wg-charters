      The Social Web Incubator Community Group (also known as SocialCG, or
      SWICG) is the successor of the [Social Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg), which ran from
      2014 to 2018.
    </p>
    <h2 id="goals">
      Goals
    </h2>

        (2014-2017), and related technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incubate new proposals which build on or complement the Social Web WG
        recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scope-of-work">

      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope

    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.

    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=

      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.

    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public, e.g. on the <a
      href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swicg/">public-swicg@w3.org
      mailing list</a>,

      mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. The Group makes decisions in the following ways: either Committers assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] (see below) to allow multi-day
      online feedback for a proposed course of action.
      After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision
      should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution
      of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
      resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
      meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
      A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions via
      email to public-swicg@w3.org, preferably with the abbreviation CfC early
      in the subject line to catch more attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any group participant may object to a
      decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 14 days of
      publication of the decision, provided that they include
      clear reasons for their objection grounded in the scope and documented
      goals of the CG and its work items.
    </p>
    <h3 id="calls-for-consensus">
      Calls for Consensus
    </h3>
    <p>
      The presence of formal resolutions will be indicated by a "CfC" prefix in
      the subject line of an email on the list. Additional outreach to community
      venues for more affirmative consent is strongly encouraged. There will be
      a response period of 14 days. If no sustained objections are raised by the
      end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
      consensus as a resolution of the Community Group, i.e. a group decision.
      All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and
      until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
      discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to this decision process.
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chairs
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/chair/role.html">role of the Chair is described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/">Art of Consensus</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group participants elect (and/or other chairs appoint) no
      fewer than One (1) and no more than Three (3) Chairs for the group at any
      given time. The W3C Team Contact of the group SHOULD NOT be one of the
      chairs at any point. Participation as Chair is afforded to the specific
      individuals elected to those positions, and a participant&quot;s seat MUST
      NOT be delegated to any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most Chair nominees, the primary affiliation is their employer and
      will match their affiliation in the W3C database. For contractors and
      independents, this will normally be their contracting company or their
      independent status; in some cases (e.g. where a consultant is consulting
      for only one organization) this may be the organization for whom the
      nominee is consulting.
      <strong>Chair nominees, elected chairs, and appointed chairs MUST have
      unique affiliations publicly stated at time of nomination, election (if it
      has changed since last disclosure), or appointment.</strong>
      Publicly stating additional or secondary affiliations is not required but
      recommended. An organization with which one or more participants are
      affiliated MAY submit one ballot that ranks candidates in their preferred
      order as an organization as an informational exhibit; individual
      participants should still vote explicitly, whether concurring or
      dissenting with such an exhibit.
    </p>

    <h2 id="choosing-chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At any given time there may be up to three co-chairs, each holding one
        seat. Each seat defines a 2 year cycle of service.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the first election after ratification of this charter, all seats will
        be up for election. Thereafter, in each year, a single election will be
        held to fill any vacant seats.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the case of interim vacancy, the remaining chairs may appoint a
        co-chair for each open seat, hold an election for the same, or wait
        until the next election, at their discretion. If the chairs do not take
        any action, the seat will automatically be up for election in the next
        cycle. Any such interim appointments or elections shall hold the seat
        until the end of its natural cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reelection is restricted to two consecutive terms, with the possibility
        of being reelected after sitting out one election cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        In an election year, current chairs will select a date for elections,
        which will set a nomination period of two weeks, starting 4 weeks prior
        to the election.
      </li>
      <li>
        For an individual to run for election, they must self-nominate and make
        a statement regarding their background and why they are running, on the
        group mailing list.
      </li>
      <li>
        The current chairs will host a conference call during the nomination
        period, during which candidates may make a statement and answer
        questions from the community.
      </li>
      <li>
        If, at the end of nominations, any given seat only has a single
        candidate, that candidate immediately wins that seat. For any seats with
        multiple nominees, there will be an election for those seats.
      </li>
      <li>
        If, after nominations, any given seat has no candidates, the remaining
        chairs after any election (if necessary for other seats), will address
        the vacancy as an interim vacancy, described above.
      </li>
      <li>
        To elect one of multiple candidates, a vote will be held by the election
        mechanism of ranked choice voting, in which voters rank candidates by
        preference on their ballots. The candidate with the majority (more than
        50%) of first-choice votes wins outright. If no candidate gets a
        majority of first-choice votes, the candidate who ranked the worst is
        eliminated, and that candidate&quot;s voters&quot; ballots are
        redistributed to their second-choice pick. If the vote results in a tie,
        an immediate runoff of the top two candidates shall be held. If the vote
        remains tied, the winner shall be the candidate whose nomination was
        first recorded publicly on the group email list.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="offboarding-chairs">
      Chair Offboarding
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A chair may voluntarily off-board at any given time; this should be done
        publicly and on the mailing list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chairs may also be removed from their duties through a no-confidence
        vote.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a participant of the community group wishes to call for the recall of
        a chair, for any reason, that participant must first privately
        communicate with one or more of the other chairs
        their desire and reason for doing so. Those chairs must give the
        participant an opportunity to discuss their concerns with a goal of
        resolving them. If, after 30 days, the participant feels their issues
        have not been adequately addressed, they may then escalate to a public
        call for a no-confidence vote (without having to disclose with whom they
        have been discussing the matter). If, after 60 days, the participant has
        not made a call for a no-confidence vote, the matter should be
        considered dropped; any further attempts to remove the chair in question
        must begin with a new round of private communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        A public call for no-confidence must be announced to the group email
        list stating the name of the chair subject to the recall. This
        announcement must come from the participant who initiated the private
        communication with the chairs to discuss their concerns. At least two
        other supporting participants MUST reply to that email on the public
        list within 48 hours to confirm their support for a no-confidence vote
        of the chair in question.
      </li>
      <li>
        The other chairs must acknowledge the call for no-confidence within 7
        days of all three participants declaring their support.
      </li>
      <li>
        UNLESS the chair in which no-confidence has been expressed voluntarily
        offboards and opts out of the session on the mailing list, and within 30
        days of a call for no-confidence, the other chairs MUST hold a
        conference call at which the parties seeking no-confidence will have an
        opportunity to present their case and participants of the group will be
        able to ask clarifying questions. The chair in question SHALL NOT
        moderate this call. They will, however, have equal time to respond
        during that same call to the case made against them.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the week following this conference call, participants may cast
        votes in favor or against the recall by posting to the email list.
      </li>
      <li>
        If affirmative votes cast that week (in favor of recall) comprise
        greater than two-thirds of the total votes cast, then the chair in
        question is removed and the seat shall be treated as an interim vacancy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Participants are not required to vote. Abstentions may be recorded; such
        abstentions shall not count towards the total number of votes when
        calculating the two-thirds majority.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Chair who has been removed may stand for reelection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only one call for no-confidence, for one chair, may be in process at any
        given time. Priority shall be given to the first such vote to be
        publicly called. Any subsequent public calls must wait until any
        previous recalls are resolved, then must start with private
        communication as described above.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="task-forces">
      Task Forces
    </h2>
    <p>
      Task Forces are lightweight organizational subsets of the Community Group
      that serve to channel work and attention to tasks (and allow others to
      "tune out" of the many topics and work items proceeding in parallel that
      are  less pressing for them). They can schedule their own topic calls
      (i.e. public, minuted meetings on the CG calendar) and can tag niche email threads with the name of their task force as a courtesy to the rest of the group. When minutes from task-force specific topic calls are uploaded, they are marked by task force name. "Task Forces" are spun up by community group resolution, usually to work on a work item at any stage of formalization or to accomplish some other objective, and can be spun down or change scope at any time by internal consensus. The convener of a task force does NOT need to be the "champion" of a work item being coordinated in it, NOR do they need to be a Committer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="committers">
      Committers
    </h2>

    <p>
      A <dfn>Committer</dfn> is authorized to make changes to one or more GitHub repositories that are managed by the group. Participants can earn Committer status through a history of useful contributions. Committer status is granted through consensus, as discussed in <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a>. There is no limit to the number of Committers in the group or on a repository. There is no time limit on Committer status. Each repository for ongoing work items should have at least one active Committer other than the Chairs. Chair(s) can revoke Committer status for any reason, and will notify the community. A Committer can give up the role voluntarily.
    </p>

    <h2 id="past-decisions">
      Decisions made prior to Adoption of this Charter
    </h2>

    <p>
      From 2017 to 2024, the SocialCG operated under the same process as its predecessor, the Social Web Working Group. Where they conflict, the
      terms of this charter supercede any decisions made during that time. All decisions made during that time that are compatible with this charter stand.
    </p>

    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
