# Potential SWICG Charters

Discussion of potential CG and WG charters

## Contributing

The goal here is to iterate these charter documents to a point where they can be ratified, via "single-topic" PRs (each addressing one issue or replacing one `class="remove"` section with content).
When in doubt, email the mailing list!

We recommend previewing your own PRs by simply opening the HTML file in a browser (locally), and previewing those of others by clicking into the "Files" view of each PR and selecting "View File" from the `...` menu, then "download".
Note: on mobile, this _may_ download as a `.txt` file, which may need to be renamed/retyped locally before opening.)
